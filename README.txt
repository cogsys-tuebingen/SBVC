 * This file is part of SBVC, the systems biology visualizer and
 * converter. This tools is able to read a plethora of systems biology
 * file formats and convert them to an internal data structure.
 * These files can then be visualized, either using a simple graph
 * (KEGG-style) or using the SBGN-PD layout and rendering constraints.
 * Some currently supported IO formats are SBML (+qual, +layout), KGML,
 * BioPax, SBGN, etc. Please visit the project homepage at
 * <http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/SBVC> to obtain the
 * latest version of SBVC.
